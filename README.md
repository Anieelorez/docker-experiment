Project Title: Node.js Application with Git and Docker Integration

Project Description:
In this project, I developed a Node.js application and leveraged my proficiency in Git and Docker to create a seamless development and deployment pipeline. Here's an overview of the project's key components and steps:

1. **Node.js Application:** I built a Node.js application using the popular JavaScript runtime. This application is a simple web server.

2. **GitHub Repository:** I established a GitHub repository to host my project. GitHub is a widely used platform for version control, collaboration, and sharing code with the global developer community.

3. **Git Commands in VSCode:** I utilized the Git command-line interface (CLI) within the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) editor to manage the version control of my project. This involved adding, committing, and pushing code changes to the GitHub repository directly from the VSCode interface.

4. **Dockerization:** To containerize my Node.js application, I created a Dockerfile. This Dockerfile contained instructions to build a Docker image of my application. Containerization allows for consistent and isolated deployments across various environments.

5. **Docker Image:** After writing the Dockerfile, I used Docker commands to build a Docker image of my Node.js application. This image encapsulated all the necessary dependencies and configurations to run my application seamlessly.

6. **Docker Container:** Finally, I instantiated a Docker container from the Docker image. This containerized environment allowed me to run my Node.js application consistently, regardless of the host system's configuration.

By combining Git for version control and Docker for containerization, I created an efficient and portable development workflow. This project not only showcases my skills in these essential tools but also provides a solid foundation for future software development endeavors.
